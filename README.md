## Description
- Video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBIpGo_E5YQ.
- The Google Chrome extension version of this script uses a page action icon shown in the browser toolbar.
- The icon will be **full-color** when users navigate to a URL that contains `forum.sa-mp.com`, showing that the script is **active** and will be **grey-scale** when users navigate to any other URL, showing that the script is **inactive**.
- When the script is active, it will scan the HTML document for any hyperlinks that look like a typical censored YouTube video URL and replace the censored URL with a working one. If the hyperlink text is also censored, it will be repaired as well.
- The script will also scan for non-working YouTube embedded video players **[ame]...[/ame]** and will replace them with a working one.
